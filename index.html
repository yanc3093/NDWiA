                    About this project
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This project was an individual school assignment completed in April 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was provided with a dataset containing about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations 
                    across Australia. The objective of this project was to build different classification models that could 
                    predict whether tomorrow would be warmer than today or not.

                <h3>
                    Project outcomes
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As usual, I started the project with data exploration and preprocessing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, I built 6 different classification models using the respective functions provided by the R libraries:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Decision Tree: "tree"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Naive Bayes: "e1071"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bagging and Boosting: "adabag"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Random Forest: "randomForest"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Artificial Neural Network: "neuralnet"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To measure the models' performance, I computed the prediction accuracy as well as the Area Under the Curve 
                    (AUC). Below is a screenshot of the result.
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/1.png" alt="Result 1">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Besides, I also plotted the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for each classification model.
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="images/2.png" alt="Result 2">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Based on the observations above, I finally concluded that the Artificial Neural Network is the "best" 
                    classifier among all the models for this use case.
                </p>

                    Below is a snippet of my codework, which was written using the R programming language.
